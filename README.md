# llmon-py
a simple interface for local hosting of ggml formatted large language models for windows

hopefully someone can be inspired to build something great from this! 

it gets the basics done, conversation is passed back to the model each reply from the user

this seems to give models a decent ability to recall things from their 'memory'

TODO improve readme/everything
